          <p>
            An MSc, or Master of Science, is the European equivalent of the
            American MS degree, also called Master of Science. Both are
            considered STEM degrees, focusing on science, engineering,
            technology, mathematics, and medicine. In addition, some MSc
            programs focus on social sciences. Those seeking a career in one of
            these fields could benefit from an MSc or MS degree.

          <h1>M.Sc. in Chemistry (Pharmaco Informatics)</h1>
          <p>
            MS Pharma Pharmacoinformatics is a study focused on the role of
            information technology in the medication use process. It trains
            pharmacists to be informatics-savvy, which can lead to better
            patient outcomes. A survey of public and private university pharmacy
            lecturers and pharmacists registered with the Ministry of Health in
            Malaysia assessed the value of this type of course. In fact,
            students who pursued the program were more likely to work in the
            health care industry after graduation.
